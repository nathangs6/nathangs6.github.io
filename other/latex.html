            Guide to Setting up my LaTeX Workflow using Atom
        </h1>
        <p>
            This is my current setup for my LaTeX workflow. Since I frequently change operating systems I figured I'd save the setup process here for future reference. I'll also include all my setup files in case anyone wants to use this setup as well.

        <h2>
            1. Installing TexLive
        </h2>
        <p>
            The first step is to install tex onto your system. For Linux and Mac TexLive is typically used. For Windows you have two options, MikTex and TexLive. I use TexLive on my Windows systems. To install TexLive go <a href="https://tug.org/texlive/"> here</a> and follow the install instructions. <br> When installing on Windows I ran into some difficulties with install time. The default mirror chosen when installing TexLive may not be close to you and result in incredibly long download times. To get around this I'd recommend first installing the basic scheme, and then use the Tex Live Manager to install the full scheme. When installing through the command prompt or terminal, there will be an option for this which you can find on <a href="https://tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html"> this</a> page. <br>
            <b>Remark:</b> Take note of where you installed TexLive, you may need this later on when setting up the atom-latex package.
        </p>

        <h2>
            2. Installing Atom
        </h2>
        <p>
            To install Atom, go <a href="https://atom.io/"> here</a>. I chose Atom as it is easy enough to install across the main operating systems. Vim is a bit trickier to setup, as well as requiring a bit more mental effort to set it up.
        </p>
        <h2>
            3. Getting Atom Packages
        </h2>
        <p>
            Atom has many packages that you can use to customize how it looks and functions. There are three community packages that I recommend installing for this workflow. You can install packages by searching for them in the install section of settings.
        </p>
        <h3>
            1. language-latex
        </h3>
        <p>
            This package gives Atom the LaTeX grammar. A grammar is essentially a file type recognizer that Atom will use to allow specific functions when editing that type of file. For example, snippets use grammars to have filetype specific snippets. <br> There is an option for enabling default snippets. It's up to you if you want to include these, I've chosen to disable them and have included my personally defined ones below.
        </p>
        <h3>
            2. latex
        </h3>
        <p>
            Next we install the latex package. There are three things that I check after having installed this package.
            <ul>
                <li>It's TexLive path is correct.</li>
                <li>.pdf is not in the clean patterns. Typically I'll clean the directory every once in a while to keep everything neat, however I don't want the output pdf to be deleted so this ensures it is not.</li>
                <li>Disable the "Open result after build" and "Open result in background" options. If you want to use an external pdf viewer when you are editing your LaTeX document then don't disable these options. If you want to use an external editor I have used SumatraPDF before and I find it works well enough. I prefer to use the pdf-view package which we install next.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>
            3. pdf-view
        </h3>
        <p>
            Finally we install the pdf-view package. If you want to use an external pdf viewer skip this step and just indicate in the latex package settings which pdf viewer you want to use. I, however, prefer to have the pdf opened in the Atom editor itself.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Setting up Snippets</h2>
        <p>
            Now to the fun part. We can use snippets in Atom to make typing LaTeX easier. To make snippets open snippets.cson in any text editor (though you may as well use Atom). In Atom you can open it directly from the file dropdown, or you can open it manually from the .atom directory (C:\Users\user\.atom is default on Windows). The structure of a snippet is as follows:
            <code>
        <pre>'.text.tex.latex':
          'General Environment':
            'prefix': 'beg'
            'body': """
            \\\\begin{$1}
            $2
            \\\\end{$1}
            """</pre>
      </code>
            <br> There are several parts to this that we will breakdown,
            <ul>
                <li>'.text.tex.latex': This indicates which scope you want to use. This is the scope for basic .tex files. Use '.text.tex.latex math.other.string' for snippets only accessible inside math environments. </li>
                <li>'General Environment': This is the name of the snippet that will popup in the autocomplete.</li>
                <li>'prefix': 'beg': This is what you have to type (and then tab) to expand the snippet.</li>
                <li>'body': This is what the expanded snippet produces.
                    <ul>
                        <li>$1: The $ followed by a number indicates which tab stop this is. $1 is first, then $2, and so on. $0 is the last one. If a number appears more than once then a cursor will appear in all appearances of it, and typing will type in all those places.</li>
                        <li>'body': 'expansion here': Use single quotes for one line snippets. Putting in \n (newline) will make these multiline. </li>
                        <li>'body': """ expansion here """: Use three double quotes to indicate a multiline snippet (as in the example above). </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br> So for example in a latex file we could type "beg'tab'align*'tab'2 + 2 = 4" to give us an align* environment with 2 + 2 = 4 inside of it.<br> I've attached a link to my snippets.cson file in the resources section below.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Resources
        </h2>
        <p>Here are a list of resources that I use.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>My snippets.cson file can be found <a href="https://github.com/nathangs6/latex_files"> here</a>.</li>
            <li><a href="https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/"> This</a> page was my initial inspiration for setting this up. They have a very nice Vim setup.</li>
            <li><a href="https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols"> This</a> is a nice page with many of the math symbols and their LaTeX code.</li>
        </ul>
